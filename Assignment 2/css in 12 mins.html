				<p> My name is Matthew Tigue Reber. I am from a small town 90 miles north of Philadelphia called
				"Schuylkill County". I switched from public to private and back to public among my 12 years of completion 
				for a high school diploma; but enjoyed most of my time spent.
				</p>
				<p>I moved to California with a friend two years ago seeking oppurtunity in the cultivation industry of 
				marijuana. However our plan was not succesful with only getting our medical cards. With that all being said 
				I am still happy with being in a area with much more oppurtunity than my small home town.
				</p>
				<p> I currently am emplyed with three employers in the bay area in  which I have became and active union member in one and in the pursuit of kitchen manager in the other. I am also  fulfilling my intrest in computers with receiving an education on Web-Development at Job-Train.
